Smart Wheelchair

Lead programmer / software architect who helped design with a team the software architecture of a smart wheelchair equipped with a robotic arm that can open doors and operate elevators. 

It had 3 components : a computer vision Algorithm built using OpencV, a Full stack web application and an algorithm embedded into an Arduino mega to control the robotic arm, each part communicating with each other through TCP/IP networking requests. 

I was in charge of the full stack app using Javascript/ Node Js and the control algorithm using Arduino
